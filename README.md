AI-Powered Disease Assistant WebApp

As part of my internship journey, this is my third project — an AI-powered Disease Assistant designed to help users get instant, AI-generated information about diseases in a simple and interactive way.

Project Description
This web app allows users to ask questions related to any disease — such as symptoms, causes, or general information — and receive accurate, easy-to-understand responses powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The goal of this project is to improve awareness and clarity by making medical information more accessible through AI (for educational purposes only).


What I Built
-User-Friendly Interface using Gradio for smooth interaction
-AI Backend Integration using OpenAI APIs to process and respond to user queries
-Web Deployment with Streamlit for real-time responses and clean UI
-Development & Testing using Jupyter Notebook to refine prompts and handle edge cases


Key Learnings-
-Integrating LLMs with front-end tools
-API handling, prompt engineering, and query sanitization
-Building real-time, interactive web applications
-Designing with a user-first mindset, especially for healthcare-related tools
